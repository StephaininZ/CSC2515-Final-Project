# Stock Market Trend Prediction by News Headlines and LSTM

This project proposes a deep learning-based stock index trend prediction model that considers the macro market sentiment and technical indicators. We develop an experimental framework for the classification problem which predicts next-day market direction. First, we incorporate sentiment context and technical indicators in the baseline XGBoost model. Second, we adopt LSTM and further revise it by introducing ARIMA prediction as an extra feature. A novelty of this work is about the joint application of sentiment, technical indicators, and conventional time series techniques in the deep learning framework. Investors would be equipped with the toolkit of both fundamental analysis as well as technical metrics to make informative and profitable investments.
